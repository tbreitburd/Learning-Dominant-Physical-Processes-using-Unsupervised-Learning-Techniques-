"""!@module Tools

@details This module contains all the tools and functions used in the project. The tools are
organized into submodules for clarity and ease of use.
The submodules are:
- `blasius_solution`: A short module containing functions to compute the blaisus solution.
- `CustomGMM`: A custom Gaussian Mixture Model class to use in the turbulent boundary layer case
in order to test the reproducibility of the results.
- `plot_funcs`: Contains all the plotting functions used in the project, with a few exceptions
- `preprocessing`: Contains functions for the 2 different methods used to compute the
derivatives terms in the Turbulent Boundary Layer case study.
- `stability_assessment`: Contains functions that together implement the dominant balance for the
stability assessment of the method.
