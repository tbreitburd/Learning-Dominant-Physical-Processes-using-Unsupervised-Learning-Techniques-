# DIS Project 24: Learning Dominant Physical Processes with data driven balance models

## Summary

This repository contains the code for the Research Project completed as partial fulfilment of the MPhil Data Intensive Science.

This project explores a relatively recent approach to identify dominant physical processes in varied physical systems using data-driven balance models. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Model clustering and Sparse Principal Component Analysis, the Callaham et al. (2021) method aims to automate the simplification of equations that govern physical phenomena, and hence their simulation.

The main goal of the project is to discuss the reproducibility of the results, using alternative code. It also delves into thoroughly testing the robustness of the methods, by testing other clustering algorithms, as well as testing the stability of the results when changing hyperparameters.

It's secondary goal was to try using that original method to some novel data, testing the ability of the model to generalise to not well-studied physical systems, as well as the flow itsefl.
